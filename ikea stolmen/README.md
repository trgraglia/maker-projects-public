# Ikea STOLMEN
### NOTICE
*As of 1.8.2016 - August 1st, 2016 - STOLMEN is now ELVARLI.*
### WHY?
I wanted to reuse some pole mounts from my stolmen on another stolmen setup in order to add more shelves. This means I would lose hooks on my current coat rack setup. The solution was not go out and buy something new since the stolmen in no longer in production. The solution was to print what was missing!

## Hooks
### IMPORTANT
- Use at your own risk. Do not add too much weight.
- The hooks have not yet been tested with weight.
- The hinge in the hooks is a pin thought the whole hook. It requires bridging but works well.
- After slicing, check the layers to ensure the pin remains seperate from the hole it is in.
### NUTS AND BOLTS
- M3x20 Screws
- M3 Nuts
